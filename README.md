# Wormhole-for-NS3
Source code to create a network with a wormhole in NS-3
A module to create a wormhole doesn't exist in the NS-3 network simulator. The attached file creates a wireless
network with 9 standard wifi nodes. A wormhole setup is created to nodes capable of wired and wireless
communication. This file also generates additional files used by NetAnim to visually see the layout of
the nodes. In addition, routing table files are generated to follow selected paths. PCAP files are also
available.
